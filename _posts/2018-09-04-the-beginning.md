I’ve been a proponent of internet driven technology ever since I laid my hand on it. My understanding of the web and the technologies at its periphery has always been superficial. Last month I decided to learn front-end web technologies to gain what they call “marketable” skills. 

It took my around 6 hours to set this blog up. It shouldn’t have taken more than an hour. This is what happens when you label a thin layer of information as knowledge. I’ll be starting off by learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Have to familiarise myself with GitHub. I plan to learn by building hobby projects as I move up. GitHub is a good platform to showcase and get feedback.

This blog will encompass my pursuit to learn front-end web development, efforts to discipline myself.
